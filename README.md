## Key Features

This project has several great features that make it stand out:

1. ðŸ¦´ **Loading Skeleton**: When the modal data is being fetched, a loading skeleton is displayed to provide a better user experience.
2. ðŸ“£ **Notification Messages**: After clicking buttons in the modal, users will receive informative notification messages.
3. ðŸ§© **Highly Abstract & Decoupled Components**: The project's components are designed to be highly abstract and decoupled, making them easier to maintain and extend.
4. ðŸ”Œ **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Users can input an ID in the input box, and the project will fetch the corresponding data from the API, providing a more interactive and flexible user experience. 
5. ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: The project supports responsive design, ensuring an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
